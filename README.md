# The Ocean Cleanup - Visual Survey App

## Introduction

Welcome to the app repository for The Ocean Cleanup Visual Surveys. The goals of the Ocean Cleanup visual surveys will be to improve the current estimate of the total mass of ocean plastic floating at the world’s ocean. The app is developed in order to support the research and expeditions to determine the dimension and amounts of ocean plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch – an accumulation zone for debris forming between Hawaii and California.

## App

In order to support the research this app, based on Appcelerator Titanium, will allow users to report sightings. Currently the app is under development, the initial release is planned for June.

## Getting Started
