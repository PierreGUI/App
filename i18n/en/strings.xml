    <!-- Guide Detail -->
    <string name="guide.prepareForSurvey.introduction">Introduction:</string>





    <string name="guide.prepareForSurvey.introductionParagraph">As a ‘debris spotter’ on a moving vessel, you are looking for debris that is floating at sea, and recording what you see in The Ocean Cleanup app.</string>
    <string name="guide.prepareForSurvey.Observer">Debris Spotter:</string>
    <string name="guide.prepareForSurvey.observerParagraph">Each survey takes 30 minutes and requires your full attention and sufficient battery of your device. Choose the side of the vessel- starboard or port side - that allows you to best see floating debris, given the available sunlight and wind conditions.\n\nYour standing point must remain the same during the entire 30-minutes visual survey.\n\nIf this is your first visual survey using this app, make sure to take some time to have a look at our guide and settings. The settings tab gives you the option to choose between Metric and Imperial systems for the measurements you will have to guess during the survey.</string>

    <string name="guide.startingASurvey.introduction">Starting a survey:</string>
    <string name="guide.startingASurvey.introductionParagraph">Navigate to the ‘Welcome’ page of The Ocean Cleanup app and press ‘Start a new survey’.\n\nThe app will then give you the opportunity to either select your existing profile or create a new one. Provide your name, boat name, and platform height, which is a guess of the distance between your eyes and the mean water line.\n\nNext, it will ask you the current wind speed (use an anemometer, or guess it) and cloud coverage (guess it).\n\nYou are now ready to get the 30 minutes ocean watch started.</string>

    <string name="guide.duringTheSurvey.introduction">During the survey</string>
    <string name="guide.duringTheSurvey.introductionParagraph">You are now in a screen with a countdown timer that tells you how much time you have left before the 30 minutes survey is over.\n\nYou should focus your attention on looking for debris floating within a 90-degree arc encompassing the area ahead of the ship and one side of the track-line.\n\nYour should be searching for debris in closeby waters - 0 - 10 meters from the boat’s track-line - but debris sighted at any distance can be recorded.\n\nWhen you spot a debris, press ‘New Sighting’. You will then have to log the debris amount, material, type, size, and distance from the vessel track-line.</string>

    <string name="guide.finishTheSurvey.introduction">Finishing the survey</string>
    <string name="guide.finishTheSurvey.introductionParagraph">When the 30 minutes ocean watch is over, your phone will vibrate to let you know that the survey is over.\n\nYou wil then have the opportunity to write down any remarks you may have, such as app improvement suggestions and reports of unusual sightings (e.g. marine life, abrupt weather condition changes).</string>


    <string name="guide.startingASurvey.observer">Spotter:</string>
    <string name="guide.startingASurvey.observerParagraph">Before you start a new survey, it is important that you have filled in your personal and vessel details. This enables us to link the survey-data to the right vessel and team</string>

    <string name="guide.enterAnSpotter.info">How to setup your observer profile</string>
    <string name="guide.enterAnSpotter.infoParagraph">To setup your observer profile, go to the profiles page using the menu or simply press 'start survey'. On the profiles page you will be able to create a new profile using the 'new profile' button.</string>

    <string name="guide.howToReportFeedback.title">Got Feedback?</string>
    <string name="guide.howToReportFeedback.paragraph">Is the answer to your question not available in this guide? Do you experience a problem with the use of the app or when conducting a survey? Please don't hesitate to contact us.\n\napp@theoceancleanup.com</string>

    <string name="more.toc">Plastic pollution has become a major hazard to marine life and is also leading to aesthetic degradation, economic losses, and impacts on human health. The Ocean Cleanup aims to mitigate ocean plastic pollution by starting effective at-sea cleanup operations. By developing technologies to extract, prevent, and intercept plastic pollution. The Ocean Cleanup’s goal is to fuel the world’s fight against oceanic plastic pollution, by initiating the largest cleanup in history.\n\nhttp://www.theoceancleanup.com</string>

    <string name="more.goal">By conducting visual surveys the Ocean Cleanup will be able to estimate the amounts and types of objects floating in our oceans. This knowledge is crucial to develop technologies to clean it up. Your help is greatly appreciated!</string>
